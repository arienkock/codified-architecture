This is a boilerplate project that tries to codify architecture and best-practices using statis typing, code generation, and other tools.

All results of code generation should live in a subdirectory of the architecture layer: `src/{layer}/generated`.

The primary code generation command is `npm run codegen`.

To keep the domain layer decoupled from the implementation details, dependencies on other layers and code gen output should go through the `domain-seam` layer.

All endpoints should be published via the openAPI document created in `src/webServer/openapi.ts`. The codegen will scaffold code that will route to and invoke handlers. But the handler at the domain layer must be implemented in `src/domain/handlers/{hadnler}.ts`.
